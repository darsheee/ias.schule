# British Entry Into India
## East India Company & Early British Presence (1599-1765)

The Elizabethan era's energy drove English merchants to establish the East India Company, competing with Portuguese, Dutch, and French powers in India. From trading posts at Surat, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta, British commercial interests gradually transformed into territorial ambitions, culminating in Clive's victory at Plassey (1757) and the acquisition of Diwani rights over Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.
