# Rise of British India
## Expansion & Consolidation (1766-1818)

This period saw the introduction of administrative frameworks (Regulating Act 1773, Pitt's India Act 1784), military expansion through Mysore and Maratha Wars, Governor-General Warren Hastings' consolidation, Wellesley's Subsidiary Alliance system, and the final defeat of the Marathas establishing British supremacy over the Indian subcontinent.
