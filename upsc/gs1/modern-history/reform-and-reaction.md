4. Home Rule Leagues: Two separate leagues (Besant and Tilak), not one
5. Jallianwala Bagh date: 13 Apr 1919 (Baisakhi day)
:::

::: danger Mains Important
**Partition of Bengal Impact**: Administrative measure became political catalyst - analyze how British "divide and rule" backfired, strengthened nationalism, birth of Swadeshi as economic weapon.

**Morley-Minto vs Montagu-Chelmsford**: Compare reforms - former introduced separate electorates (communal), latter introduced dyarchy (provincial responsibility).

**Jallianwala Bagh Significance**: Not just massacre, but symbol of British brutality, destroyed moderate faith, made Gandhi's mass movement inevitable.
