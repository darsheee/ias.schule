::: tip Quick Reference
**Key Events**: Partition of Bengal (1905), Congress Split (1907), Morley-Minto (1909), Delhi Durbar (1911), WWI (1914-18), Lucknow Pact (1916), Montagu-Chelmsford (1919), Jallianwala Bagh (13 Apr 1919)
:::

::: warning Common Mistakes
1. Separate electorates: Introduced in 1909, NOT 1919 (extended in 1919)
2. Dyarchy: Provincial only, NOT central
3. Bengal Partition: 1905, Annulled: 1911 (6-year duration)
4. Home Rule Leagues: Two separate leagues (Besant and Tilak), not one
5. Jallianwala Bagh date: 13 Apr 1919 (Baisakhi day)
:::

::: danger Mains Important
**Partition of Bengal Impact**: Administrative measure became political catalyst - analyze how British "divide and rule" backfired, strengthened nationalism, birth of Swadeshi as economic weapon.

**Morley-Minto vs Montagu-Chelmsford**: Compare reforms - former introduced separate electorates (communal), latter introduced dyarchy (provincial responsibility).

**Jallianwala Bagh Significance**: Not just massacre, but symbol of British brutality, destroyed moderate faith, made Gandhi's mass movement inevitable.
