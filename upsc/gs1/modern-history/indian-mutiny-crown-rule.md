# Indian Mutiny & Crown Rule
## The Great Revolt & Transition to Crown Administration (1857-1876)

The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857-58, also called the First War of Independence, marked a watershed in Indian history. Following the rebellion's suppression, the British Crown assumed direct control from the East India Company (1858). This period saw major administrative restructuring, the Queen's Proclamation promising equal treatment, military reorganization, and gradual introduction of legislative reforms through the Indian Councils Acts.
