::: tip Revision Strategy
Master the foundational agreements with USA (LEMOA, COMCASA, BECA)! Remember specific trade deficits (China $83B, US $32B in their favor). Understand Russia's importance despite diversification. Note key border incidents (Galwan 2020, Doklam 2017). Remember BRI vs Indo-Pacific competition. Connect bilateral relations with regional organizations (Quad, BRICS, SCO). Know energy partnerships (US LNG, Russia nuclear, China Brahmaputra). Understand India's balancing act - strategic autonomy across relationships!
