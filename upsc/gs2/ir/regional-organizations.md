::: tip Revision Strategy
Remember each organization's formation year, headquarters, and core objectives! Understand why SAARC failed while BIMSTEC shows promise. Know India's specific interests in each grouping. Master BRICS statistics (31.5% GDP PPP). Understand Quad's non-military nature vs China's concerns. Note SCO's "three evil forces." Connect regional organizations with India's foreign policy doctrines (Neighbourhood First, Act East). Remember vaccine diplomacy in COVID context!
