::: tip Revision Strategy
Remember the four types of pressure groups! Focus on FCRA 2020 amendments and their impact. Master successful civil society movements - RTI, anti-corruption, farmers' protests. Balance both the positive role (accountability, service delivery) and concerns (transparency, representativeness). Note the shrinking civil society space criticism. Connect with democracy and governance themes. Remember key statistics - 31 lakh NGOs, 6000+ FCRA cancelled!
